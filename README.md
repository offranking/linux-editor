Mini project - Linux Text Editor


# In this project, I am working with the VIM editor.

I started by using the touch command to create a file named exercise.txt, then opened it with vim exercise.txt from my local terminal to add some text. After editing, I used the cat exercise.txt command to view the content of the file.

# Working with the Nano Text Editor

In this part of the project, I used the touch command to create a new file named nano_file.txt

touch nano_file.txt

Next, I opened the file using the Nano text editor with the following command:

nano nano_file.txt


# Inside Nano, I typed some text and then saved and exited the editor by using:

Ctrl + O – to write (save) the changes.

Enter – to confirm the file name.

Ctrl + X – to exit Nano.

After saving the changes, I used the cat command to view the contents of the file:
cat nano_file.txt
This confirmed that the text was successfully added to the file.
