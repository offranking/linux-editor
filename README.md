# Creating and Editing a File Using Vim

I began by creating a file named exercise.txt using the touch command

* touch exercise.txt

Next, I opened the file using the Vim editor

* vim exercise.txt

Inside Vim, I entered insert mode by pressing i, typed some text, and then saved and exited the editor using the following commands:

Press Esc to exit insert mode.

Type :wq and press Enter to write (save) and quit the file.

Finally, I used the cat command to view the contents of the file:

* cat exercise.txt

This confirmed that the text was successfully written to the file.

# Working with the Nano Text Editor

In this part of the project, I used the touch command to create a new file named nano_file.txt

* touch nano_file.txt

Next, I opened the file using the Nano text editor with the following command:

* nano nano_file.txt


# Inside Nano, I typed some text and then saved and exited the editor by using:

* Ctrl + O – to write (save) the changes.

* Enter – to confirm the file name.

* Ctrl + X – to exit Nano.

After saving the changes, I used the cat command to view the contents of the file:
* cat nano_file.txt
This confirmed that the text was successfully added to the file.
